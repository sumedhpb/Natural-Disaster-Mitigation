## A platform to connect, help, and provide relief to victims of natural disasters
Developed as a part of Microsoft Codefundo 2018.


## Inspiration

Natural disasters are sudden events such as floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes that cause humongous damage to both human lives and earth's resource. With meticulous planning and sagacious implementation these can be mitigated. A small idea when implemented at the right time with the right means can aid humanity to a profuse extent.

## Platform
Here's our platform! https://hope-natural-disaster-mitigation.azurewebsites.net/

* Food
	
	This section of the platform lets people who are in search of food/groceries to request their relevant needs. The idea is to bring together donors and receivers that lets the receivers find nearby donors with available resources. The donor when in excess of food can update the information regarding the number of people he can offer food along with his geolocation. At the receiver's end, the receiver can look for nearest donors who are offering food.

* Medicine

	This section connects receivers looking for medication with the donors who possess the required meds. Donors can update the availability and quantity of the medicines he offers with his geolocation. Receiver can connect to the nearest donor with the required medication.

* Person Locator

	This section of the platform aims at connecting the disconnected members of a family with their loved ones. 
Users need to provide details of the missing ones like photo, age, gender etc for the platform to find them. On the other end, users can also update information on encountering the missing ones for their families to find them. Azure's facial recognition API is used to run a facial scan of the uploaded photos and generate a confidence score of how well the actual person's photo matches with the uploaded photo of the missing person.

* My Status 

	Users can update their safety status with their geolocation. This data can be used to identify the places to avoid going, places that are relatively safe and the locations of the casualities that need help.

	1. Places to avoid 
	The areas that are potential zones of danger and life loss are identified based on status updated from the platform users, 	  previously documented data, and other sources. Victims can refer to this information before relocating to a new place to avoid danger.

	2. Places that are relatively safe
	The areas that are relatively safe when compared to other places are listed here. A person in a particular area, can mark himself safe and rate the safety of his place on a scale of 1-5.
